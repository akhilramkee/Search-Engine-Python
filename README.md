# SEARCH ENGINE USING PYTHON
Search Engine
   
This Search Engine is based on Jorin's Work book which utilizes "PAGE RANK ALGORITHM" to rank the pages and "cosine similarity" to decide 
the similarity between the document and query.

run it in terminal:
   
   python search.py 'go' 'https://jorin.me'
   
You could use any sites but this is an example site used by me

   format:  python search.py <query>  <seed>
   
 dependencies:
 
 1) bs4
 2) numpy
 3) argparse
